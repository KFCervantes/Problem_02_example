# Problem_02_example

This is a copy of Mine Cetinkaya-Rundel's Google Trend Index Shiny application. The original repository can be found [here](https://github.com/rstudio/webinars/tree/master/47-introduction-to-shiny/apps/goog-index).

The purpose of this copy was to test the application locally before replacements to the data were made.
